          <h2>Denise Silver</h2>
          <h3>PowerPoint Specialist and <br> Résumé Coach</h3>
        </p>

        <p>Going out on my own! With 25 years of experience in IT, project management, marketing, training, and staffing, I joined the gig economy. This offers freedom to accept interesting work in corporate, academic, and social settings.</p>
        <p>A graduate of Muhlenberg College and George Washington University with degrees in Spanish, I was headed for a career in teaching&horbar;but computer programming grabbed me first. Yet my Spanish has come in handy with many corporate requests for translations.</p>
        <p>My career spans diverse industries, such as home health care, water utilities, insurance, and academia. Along the way, I showed a knack for recruiting talented people, and hired hundreds of them. I read thousands of resumes and know how to create a winning one.</p>
        <p>Over several decades, I facilitated hundreds of meetings to capture information, define business processes, and design websites. I even co-authored a book on how to do this. I created and delivered PowerPoint presentations that helped people market their products, inspire their audience, and tell their story. Now I’m ready to work with you on your next presentation!</p>
        <p>What motivates me when I’m not creating presentations? I love playing tennis, capturing photos (with a real camera), frequenting neighborhood cappuccino bars, and accompanying my singing children on the piano.</p>
        <p>If you’re looking for a creative, collaborative communicator who can help you design presentations that satisfy your goals to persuade, inform and entertain&horbar;I’m your partner.</p>
